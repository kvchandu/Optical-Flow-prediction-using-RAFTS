# Optical-Flow-prediction-using-RAFTS

This GitHub repository focuses on optical flow, a fundamental concept in computer vision.
Optical flow is a technique used to track the motion of objects in consecutive frames of a video.
By analyzing pixel-level movements, it enables the understanding of object trajectories and the detection of dynamic events. 
This repository provides robust and efficient implementations of various optical flow algorithms, offering researchers and developers a valuable resource for tasks such as object tracking, motion analysis, and video processing in computer vision applications.

This GitHub repository serves as a reimplementation of RAFT-S, a compact variant of the state-of-the-art RAFT (Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms) model. The purpose of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in the RAFT model. RAFT-S was chosen due to its smaller parameter space, making it more approachable for learning purposes. By exploring and reconstructing RAFT-S, this repository offers valuable insights into the inner workings of the RAFT framework.
